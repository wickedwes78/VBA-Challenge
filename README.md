# VBA-Challenge
# Description
This project analysis annual stock exchange data for 2018, 2019 and 2020.
The data analysed consists of reporting the the yearly change, yearly percent change and total stock volumne for each stock.

# Visuals
Included in the files are screen shots of the results for each year

# Installation
The included files are VBA files intended to be run of the following files (alphabetical testing) (Multiple_year_stock_data).

# Authors and acknowledgment
I have asked AskBCS Learning Assistant for assistance with removing errors.  They provided some ways to look at removing errors.

# Project status
My code was fully working for the sample data. Upon running it for the full data (file Multiple_year_stock_data) it misses ticker symbols and therefore does not show data for the full series of ticker symbols./

In addition, the VBA takes at least two hours to fully run on the full data./
